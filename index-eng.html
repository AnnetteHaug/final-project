    <h1>What is FREE LEARNING</h1>

    <p> The basic right to education is a cornerstone of our democracy, and by extension one of our most important institutions.
        It is our opinion that education should be as cheap and accessible as possible for the wider population,
        and not be locked behind requirements, loans and official institutions. Free Learning is a repository accessible by anyone be 
        they citizens, immigrants, young or old. Our repository is developed in cooperation with the Norwegian Department of Education
        and is continously developed to provide service to as wide an audience as possible. <br></p>

     <p> To achieve the goal of improved access to education we at Free Learning have developed a repository where you can find
         Lectures, reading material and projects on a wide variety of subjects. The material in our repository is shared by lecturers and students
         wanting to share their understanding of different topics. <br><br>

         The prototype can be found <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="index-prod-eng.html">here</a>
         <br>
     </p>

     <h3>Users and Logg inn</h3>

     <p> Due to the repositories nature only confirmed lecturers and students have access to the upload function for now.
         The logg inn function uses the same system as Norwegian universities and schools do. Students and teachers also have some
         differences in what they can contribute, with only teachers being allowed to upload lectures.

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>
    Our mission is to create an easy to use way for people to gain access educational content. By making this material into a public good
    we can make it accessible to a wider section of the population and hopefully increase interrest in education and innovation. <br><br>
    
    To make education as available as possible we here at Free Learning have created a repository that's free to use for anyone who 
    wishes. Here students and teachers can upload their lectures and notes to make them available to the wider public. We're also 
    aiming to work with universities across the country to get permissions and support in this.

      <h3>About us</h3>
      <div id="visjontext">
          <p>
            As students at Oslo Metropolitan University we were tasked with creating a solution for one of the UNs sustainability goals. 
            To achieve this we've decided to tackle the important question of improved and accessible education. Through our preliminary work
            we've seen that many developed countries have come a long way with online education and had great success with this, especially during 
            the ongoing pandemic. We want to expand on the idea of online education, spesifically it's accessibility. Many sites today are prohibitively
            expensive or locked behind institutions. We want our project to be publicly availible, a free service and a tool for individual students and 
            classes alike.<br><br><br>
